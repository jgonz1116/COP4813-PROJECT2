      "summary_short": "In a film both sweeter and loopier than &quot;Fargo,&quot; Joel and Ethan Coen and their rogues' gallery of actors explore Southern California's post-hippie, surfer-dude bowling scene. The results are irresistible, at least for audiences on the film's laid-back wavelength and in tune with its deadpan humor. With shaggy, baggy looks that belie his performance's fine comic control, Jeff Bridges plays a guy who truly deserves to be called Dude, and is by turns oblivious and indignant once a ruined rug leads him into neo-noir escapades. In a film that certainly keeps its audience guessing what might happen next (Saddam Hussein renting bowling shoes?), John Turturro takes the cake as the most fiendish of bowlers. \u2014 Janet Maslin",
