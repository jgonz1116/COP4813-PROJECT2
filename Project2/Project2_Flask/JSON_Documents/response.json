Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich are childhood friends on the Confederate side, and the pop star Jewel (in her movie debut) is a young widow they both love. Even cooler in tone than &quot;The Ice Storm,&quot; the movie is visually stunning and historically provocative but dramatically flat. \u2014 Stephen Holden",

The hero, a jowly, sad-faced welder (Markku Peltola), wakes up after a vicious mugging to find himself suffering from complete amnesia. But his state of dislocation turns out also to be a state of grace, as he finds friendship in a shipping-container shanty-town and love with a Salvation Army worker (Kati Outinen). The movie, with its easy, graceful humor and its plainspoken sense of decency, recalls the great populist films of the 1930's and early 40's: there are traces of Charlie Chaplin, Preston Sturges and Frank Capra in Mr. Kaurismaki's democractic aesthetic, and like them he has made a simple, poignant comedy whose intended audience is nothing less than the human race. \u2014 A.

This bearded, soft-spoken 46-year-old dreamer works mostly outdoors, creating mutable sculptures that he calls earthworks. As the film's images accumulate, the movie becomes a sustained and ultimately refreshing meditation on surrender to the idea of temporality. If Mr. Goldsworthy's humility in the face of change reminds us that all is vanity, his playfulness also reminds us that a fervent engagement in the moment is in its own way infinite. &#151; Stephen Holden\n",
